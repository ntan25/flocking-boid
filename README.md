# flocking-boid

## Overview: 

The flocking boid(bird-oid) algorithm is a pretty neat algorithm developed to model how birds flock. There are three main rules here that we take into account: 
- Cohesion: Boids will move to some collective center
- Separation: Boids will not overlap and will keep some buffer distance 
- Alignment: Boids in some local group will align their velocities so as to move in the same direction 

## To Do: 
- Implement SFML
